## Installation

First, [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Then create a database called "digits".

```

$ createdb digits
Password:
$

```

Second, go to [https://github.com/ralph-uy-aes/digits](https://github.com/ralph-uy-aes/digits), and click the "Use this template" button. Complete the dialog box to create a new repository that you own that is initialized with this template's files.

Third, go to your newly created repository, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system. Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a great choice if you use MacOS or Windows.

Fourth, cd into the directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```

$ npm install

```

Fifth, create a `.env` file from the `sample.env`. Set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to match your PostgreSQL database that you created in the first step. See the Prisma docs [Connect your database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases/connect-your-database-typescript-postgresql). Then run the Prisma migration `npx prisma migrate dev` to set up the PostgreSQL tables.

```

$ npx prisma migrate dev
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "<your database name>", schema "public" at "localhost:5432"

Applying migration `20240708195109_init`

The following migration(s) have been applied:

migrations/
â””â”€ 20240708195109_init/
â””â”€ migration.sql

Your database is now in sync with your schema.

âœ” Generated Prisma Client (v5.16.1) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 51ms

$

```

Then seed the database with the `/config/settings.development.json` data using `npx prisma db seed`.

```

$ npx prisma db seed
Environment variables loaded from .env
Running seed command `ts-node --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"} prisma/seed.ts` ...
Seeding the database
Creating user: admin@foo.com with role: ADMIN
Creating user: john@foo.com with role: USER
Adding stuff: Basket (john@foo.com)
Adding stuff: Bicycle (john@foo.com)
Adding stuff: Banana (admin@foo.com)
Adding stuff: Boogie Board (admin@foo.com)

ðŸŒ± The seed command has been executed.
$

```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed and the database seeded, you can run the application by invoking the "dev" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/master/app/package.json):

```

$ npm run dev

> nextjs-application-template-1@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

â–² Next.js 14.2.4

- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env

âœ“ Starting...
âœ“ Ready in 1619ms

```

### Viewing the running app

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/main/config/settings.development.json), or else register a new account.

### ESLint

You can verify that the code obeys our coding standards by running ESLint over the code in the src/ directory with:

```
$ npm run lint

> nextjs-application-template-1@0.1.0 lint
> next lint

âœ” No ESLint warnings or errors
$
```

## Walkthrough

#### Landing page

When you retrieve the app at http://localhost:3000, this is what should be displayed:

![](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/raw/main/doc/landing-page.png)

The next step is to use the Login menu to either Login to an existing account or register a new account.

#### Login page

Clicking on the Login link, then on the Sign In menu item displays this page:

#### Register page

Alternatively, clicking on the Login link, then on the Sign Up menu item displays this page:

#### Landing (after Login) page, non-Admin user

Once you log in (either to an existing account or by creating a new one), the navbar changes as follows:

You can now add new Contacts, and list the Contacts you have created. Note you cannot see any Contact created by other users.

#### Add Contact page

After logging in, here is the page that allows you to add new contact:

#### List Contact page

After logging in, here is the page that allows you to list all the Contact you have created:

You click the "Edit" link to go to the Edit Contact page, shown next.

#### Edit Contact page

After clicking on the "Edit" link associated with a contact, this page displays that allows you to change and save it:

#### Landing (after Login), Admin user

You can define an "admin" user in the settings.json file. This user, after logging in, gets a special entry in the navbar:


#### Admin page (list all users stuff)

To provide a simple example of a "super power" for Admin users, the Admin page lists all of the Contacts by all of the users:

Note that non-admin users cannot get to this page, even if they type in the URL by hand.

### CSS

The application uses the [React implementation of Bootstrap 5](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). You can adjust the theme by editing the `src/app/globals.css` file. To change the theme override the Bootstrap 5 CSS variables.

```css
/* Change bootstrap variable values.
 See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/css-variables/
 */
body {
  --bs-light-rgb: 236, 236, 236;
}

/* Define custom styles */
.gray-background {
  background-color: var(--bs-gray-200);
  color: var(--bs-dark);
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}
```

### Routing

For display and navigation among its four pages, the application uses [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).

Routing is defined by the directory structure.

### Authentication

For authentication, the application uses the NextAuth package.

When the database is seeded, a settings file (such as [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/main/config/settings.development.json)) is used to create users and stuff in the PostgreSQL database. That will lead to a default accounts being created.

The application allows users to register and create new accounts at any time.

### Authorization

Only logged in users can manipulate Stuff items (but any registered user can manipulate any Stuff item, even if they weren't the user that created it.)

### Configuration

The [config](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/main/config) directory is intended to hold settings files. The repository contains one file: [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/main/config/settings.development.json).

The [.gitignore](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/main/.gitignore) file prevents a file named settings.production.json from being committed to the repository. So, if you are deploying the application, you can put settings in a file named settings.production.json and it will not be committed.

### Quality Assurance

#### ESLint

The application includes a [.eslintrc.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/main/.eslintrc.json) file to define the coding style adhered to in this application. You can invoke ESLint from the command line as follows:

```
[~/nextjs-application-template]-> npm run lint

> nextjs-application-template-1@0.1.0 lint
> next lint

âœ” No ESLint warnings or errors
[~/nextjs-application-template]->
```

ESLint should run without generating any errors.

It's significantly easier to do development with ESLint integrated directly into your IDE (such as VSCode).
